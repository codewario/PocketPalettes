# PocketPalettes
Palette files for the Analogue Pocket to be used with GB games. These palette files were generated from the [PocketLibraryImages](https://github.com/codewario/PocketLibraryImages) project.

## Installation

Download the `gbc_palettes` archive from the [Releases](https://github.com/codewario/PocketPalettes/releases) page, then copy the folders inside to your SD card under `/Assets/gb/common/Palettes`.

Now you can select them when you go to the Custom Palette option when selecting the GB palette to use in the Pocket settings.

## Palette Categories

- **Game Palettes**
  - These are the palettes used for certain GB games on the GBC that were
not GB-enhanced, such as Metroid II and Pokemon Red/Blue. The "_.pal"
file is a "dummy" palette used for unrecognized and unlicensed GB games.
- **Button Combo Palettes**
  - These are the alternative palettes that non-enhanced GB
games could be set to with button presses and combinations.
- **Unused Palettes**
  - These are palettes available in the GBC boot rom but have colors or
color combinations that are not used by any game.
