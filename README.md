# PocketPalettes
Palette files for the Analogue Pocket to be used with GB games. These palette files were generated from the [PocketLibraryImages](https://github.com/codewario/PocketLibraryImages) project.

## Installation

Download the archive from the Releases page, then copy the folders inside to your SD card under `/Assets/gb/common/Palettes`.

Now you can select them when you go to the Custom Palette option when selecting the GB palette to use in the Pocket settings.
